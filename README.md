AssetInvest — Next.js project with compiled globals.css included

This package includes a handcrafted globals.css that reproduces the visual
layout of your Tailwind HTML example so you don't need to run the Tailwind CLI.
It is styled to match the hero, cards, horizontal scroll, contact form, and header.

How to run:
  npm install
  npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000

Replace public/hero-placeholder.jpg and public/images/* with your images.
